# AI-Chatbot
**Chatbot using OpenAI and PyQt**

---

**Description:**
This project implements a chatbot using the OpenAI API and PyQt for the graphical user interface. The chatbot is powered by the GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct model, allowing for natural language processing and generation of human-like responses.

---

**Features:**
- User-friendly graphical interface built with PyQt.
- Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct model for conversational capabilities.
- Allows users to interact with the chatbot by typing messages and receiving responses in real-time.
- Provides a seamless integration of OpenAI's API for efficient communication with the chatbot.
